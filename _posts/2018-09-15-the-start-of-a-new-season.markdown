with the announcement of rover ruckus, we met with other teams at the UAA Engineering and industry building for a robot in 3 days competition.
while there we watched the video releasing the robot game and made a plan for our robots. we had some workshops on 3-d modeling, went and saw the UAA welding room, and watched a neat movie about space exploration.
