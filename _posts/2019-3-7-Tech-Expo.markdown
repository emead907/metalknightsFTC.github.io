We partnered with the Wasilla High FTC team at the Tech Expo in a colaborative effort to premote FIRST through hands on demonstrations in driving the robots. We let people from the crowd drive some of the robots in the feild. We helped direct some the younger people tward the FLL teams that were set up. We even premoted FTC to the FLL kids.
