We attended the ASTE conference with the Wasilla High Robotics team as well as AkoRN 15440 to teach teachers how to teach robotics in their schools. We gave presentations on how FTC operates, the basics of coding in FTC blocks, and helped them build their own robots to complete the tasks that we had set up. Most of the teachers had some background in technology, however not a lot had backgrounds in programing. It was a great event and we saw some impressive robots built in roughly 6 hours.
