<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: we highly recommend that you plan to fly home on Sunday if possible. FTC tournaments sometimes run late, and it's awful when teams have to leave early because of flights!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is so much more than a tour! The UAA College of Engineering is offering a tour of their facilities, including stops with interactive demos, meeting with professors, and checking out labs and research. The tour includes lunch and an opportunity to meet and mingle with UAA Student Clubs such as robotics, rocketry, baja car, etc. We will also incorporate a stop at the Planetarium where we’ll be watching an engineering related film.</span></p>

Your teams are strongly encouraged to participate in this tour!</span><b> Please contact Vicki Nechodomu at </b><b>vnechodomu@alaska.edu</b><b> by Friday, Feb 9 </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">to let her know how many students &amp; chaperones she may expect from your team.</span></p>
<p><b>PIT DETAILS</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each team will have a 10 x 10 foot pit equipped with a 2 x 5 foot table and two chairs. The ceiling varies from 9-10 feet, depending on your pit’s location. Every pit will have access to 1 power outlet, so please bring a power strip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please show your team spirit and decorate to your heart's content!
