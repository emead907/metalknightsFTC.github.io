The Metal Knights are an FTC team established in the Fall of 2017 under the team number of 12651.

The Metal Knights are a high school robotics team based out of Palmer, Alaska. We collaborate to design, build, and program robots to compete in the First Tech Challenge competition, FTC. Our mission is to not only build cool robots, but also to develop leaders who collaborate to solve problems using technology while making themselves and their community a better place.
